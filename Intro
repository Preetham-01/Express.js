Express.js, or simply Express, is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
It simplifies the process of building server-side applications by offering powerful tools and middleware.

// First Express App
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
